# CSS-Grid-Layout-
CSS Grid Layout Module

This is a collection of starter templates for layouts and patterns using CSS Grid. The idea here is to show off what the technique is capable of doing and provide a starting point that can be re-purposed for other projects. Remember that browser support for Grid is good but requires fallbacks for legacy browsers.
That means a straight up copy and paste of these may not be well suited for some use cases.
Holy Grail Layout:
The ol' classic three-column layout where two sidebars and a container holding the body copy is sandwiched between a full-width header and footer. 
Flexible Holy Grail:
Everything stays intact as the viewport width changes using a fluid content container.
Responsive Holy Grail
Things get stacked up once the viewport gets narrow.

2-Columns with Header and Footer
A classic blog layout where one column is for the post and the other for a sidebar.

Flexible 2-Columns
The layout gets squishy when the viewport becomes narrow but the layout stays in place.

Responsive 2-Columns
Things get stacked up on smaller screens.

Evenly Distributed, Fit as Needed
Elements flow into the layout and end when there are no more.
